                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>My full name is Joseph Patrick Silva. Most people know me and refer to me by my middle name, Patrick. I was physically born in Las Cruces but I was raised in Truth or Consequences.<br>
				   I received my Electrical and Computer Engineering bachelors degree from NMSU in December of 1992. I moved to Albuquerque in 1995. I have worked for several companies from small to larger<br>
				   companies. I currently work for Sandia National Laboratories. I am employed as a software engineer. I have worked for notable companies like Intel Corp., Honeywell, and now Sandia.<br>
				   I have been in more of a support role as far as software is concerned. I have recently transitioned to developing software again after a long absence from developing software.<br>
				   If all goes well, I will graduate in May with my Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering. CS532 will be my last course, hopefully.</p>
				<h2>Family</h2>
				<p>I married in 1996. My wife's name is Angela. Angela and I have been married for 26.5 years. We have two grown children, Jordan and Jared. Jordan will be 25 in June and Jared will be 23 in July.<br>
				   Jared and his partner, April recently welcomed a baby girl. Her name is <a href="images/Sienna.jpeg">Sienna Elizabeth</a>. My wife and I have become grandparents. I am still adjusting to the fact that I am a grandparent.<br>
				   We have two dogs. <a href="images/Isabella-1.jpeg">Isabella</a> is a german short-haired pointer and <a href="images/Penelope-2.jpeg">Penelope</a> is a golden doodle.<br>
				   My wife works for Stellar Science in Albuquerque. She is a security specialist. She manages special access for government programs. I have no idea what she does from day to day. She says<br>
				   she'd like to tell me but she would have to dispose of me. So, I do not ask. We live in Rio Rancho, NM. We have lived in our Rio Rancho home for 19 years.<br><br>
				   I am an Aggie, Angela is a Lobo, and my daughter earned her bachelors degree from UNM. I am surrounded by Lobos.<br>
				</p>
				<h2>Interests</h2>
				<p>I enjoy the outdoors. I am not a hiker or hunter, but I do enjoy outdoor activities. I play golf. I travel from Rio Rancho to Las Cruces often to play golf. I like to participate<br>
				   in the <a href="images/AggieOpen.JPEG">Aggie Open</a> golf tournament twice per year, March and October. The Aggie Open supports all Aggie athletics. I mostly enjoy traveling back to Las Cruces. I always make a stop on campus<br>
				   to find the changes. Campus is always a special place with so much energy.<br><br>
				   I enjoy maintaining my grass and general house projects. Now that the house is getting older, things break and I like learning and discovering the new home gadgets. I like mowing my grass.<br>
				   I recently bought a nice reel mower. I am having fun experimenting with the adjustments to cut and groom my grass.<br><br>
				   I have been Cleveland High School's varsity football's videographer for 11 years. Cleveland High School is one of two high schools in Rio Rancho. Both of my kids graduated from CHS.<br>
				   My daughter played volleyball and my son played football and baseball at CHS. I enjoy Friday Night football and I enjoy traveling with the team around the state. We play a few games<br>
				   in Texas too. I am a kid at heart, but a lot of older people are too. I prefer to be surrounded by younger people. Younger people have so much energy and they see the world with fresh eyes.
