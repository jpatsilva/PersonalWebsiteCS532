		<!-- Personal general information about myself -->
		<h2>General Information</h2>
		<p>My full name is Joseph Patrick Silva. Most people know me and refer to me by my middle name, Patrick.
			I was physically born in Las Cruces but I was raised in Truth or Consequences.
			I received my Electrical and Computer Engineering bachelors degree from <a href="https://nmsu.edu/">NMSU</a> in December of 1992. I
			moved to Albuquerque in 1995. I have worked for several companies from small to larger
			companies. I currently work for Sandia National Laboratories. I am employed as a software engineer.
			I have worked for notable companies like Intel Corp., Honeywell, and now Sandia.
			I have been in more of a support role as far as software is concerned. I have recently transitioned
			to developing software again after a long absence from developing software.
			If all goes well, I will graduate in May with my Master of Science degree in Electrical and Computer
			Engineering. CS532 will be my last course, hopefully.
		</p>
		<!-- Backroung family information -->
		<h2>Family</h2>
		<p>I married in 1996. My wife's name is Angela. Angela and I have been married for 26.5 years. We have
			two grown children, Jordan and Jared. Jordan will be 25 in June and Jared will be 23 in July.
			Jared and his partner, April recently welcomed a baby girl. Her name is <a
				href="images/Sienna.jpeg">Sienna Elizabeth</a>. My wife and I have become grandparents. I am
			still adjusting to the
			fact that I am a grandparent. We have two dogs. <a href="images/Isabella-1.jpeg">Isabella</a> is a
			german short-haired pointer and <a href="images/Penelope-2.jpeg">Penelope</a> is a golden
			doodle. My wife works for Stellar Science in Albuquerque. She is a security specialist. She manages
			special access for government programs. I have no idea what she does from day to day. She says
			she'd like to tell me but she would have to dispose of me. So, I do not ask. We live in Rio Rancho,
			NM. We have lived in our Rio Rancho home for 19 years. I am an Aggie, Angela is a Lobo, and
			my daughter earned her bachelors degree from UNM. I am surrounded by Lobos.
		</p>
		<!-- General life interests -->
		<h2>Interests</h2>
		<p>I enjoy the outdoors. I am not a hiker or hunter, but I do enjoy outdoor activities. I play golf. I
			travel from Rio Rancho to Las Cruces often to play golf. I like to participate in the
			<a href="images/AggieOpen.JPEG">Aggie Open</a> golf tournament twice per year, March and October.
			The Aggie Open supports all Aggie athletics. I mostly enjoy traveling back to Las Cruces.
			I always make a stop on campus to find the changes. Campus is always a special place with so much
			energy. I enjoy maintaining my grass and general house projects. Now that the house is
			getting older, things break and I like learning and discovering the new home gadgets. I like mowing
			my grass. I recently bought a nice reel mower. I am having fun experimenting with the
			adjustments to cut and groom my grass. I have been Cleveland High School's varsity football's
			videographer for 11 years. <a href="https://cleveland.rrps.net/">Cleveland High School</a> is one of two high schools in Rio Rancho.
			Both of my kids graduated from CHS. My daughter played volleyball and my son played football and
			baseball at CHS. I enjoy Friday Night football and I enjoy traveling with the team around
			the state. We play a few games in Texas too. I am a kid at heart, but a lot of older people are too.
			I prefer to be surrounded by younger people. Younger people have so much energy and
			they see the world with fresh eyes.
