    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
        I have been playing golf since I was six years old. My dad gave me two clubs and I played with those two clubs for a year or two. A local man sold my dad a set of old golf clubs for me. My dad had them cut down to my size and I played
        with those clubs for the next few years. Between my 8th grade and 9th grade years, my dad bought me my first new set of golf clubs, <a href="http://www.golfreview.com/product/golf-clubs/irons/ben-hogan/apex-ii.html">Ben Hogan Apex II </a>.
        I played with these clubs until just a few years ago. With my kids off to college, I decided to play more golf. I bought a new set of golf clubs in 2019. I bought a set of <a href="https://www.titleist.com/product/620-mb/541C%3ARH%3A3-PW.html#start=1">Titleist</a> irons.

    <h3>Golf Tournaments</h3>
    <p>
        I have a good friend from my home town. His name is Gary. We have played a lot of golf in the last three years. We've Played in Arizona, Nevada, and all around New Mexico. We've played in golf tournaments at <a href="https://golf.nmsu.edu/">New Mexico State University Golf Course</a>
        and <a href="https://www.picachohills.com/">Picacho Hills Country Club</a> in Las Cruces.

    <h2>Grass</h2>
    <p>
        I enjoy everything about my grass. I recently purchased a <a href="images/reelMower-1.jpg">reel mower</a> . A reel mower usually has 5 to 10 blades which cut grass in a scissor action. The reel blades rotate and scissor the grass blades<br>
        between the reel blade and a bed knife that is fixed to the height you want the grass cut. Generally, the more blades the lower the cut.
