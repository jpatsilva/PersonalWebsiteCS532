<h1>Database Synchronization and Integrity</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    Database synchronization is needed between two production databases. One database is used to procure parts based on design specification. The other database is used to manufacture 
    the various design boards using the parts that are available initially input and approved in the first database. Design engineers select parts with desired specification. These parts
    are approved for use and committed to the design database. Users in a manufacturing capacity use these approved parts to manufacture the desired board. These two databases are large 
    and kept seperate to eliminate the use of non-approved parts. These parts available to manufacturing have been critically vetted. My task was to get the contents of the first database
    daily and compare with the previous days contents. If any changes are detected, XML is produced for the part containing the change. Changes can include any specification that may have 
    changed or a completely new part or a deleted part. The information obtained from the comparison is put on a devoted share to include seperation folders to indicate modifications, new,
    and deleted parts. Log information regarding the raw extract, availability of resources, run time information are all collected and placed on the share for access and use by the manufacturing
    people. A script is run daily on the share populated by the application. If changes are found, appropriate actions are taken to synchronize the manufacturing database with the design
    database. This process ensures the two databases are in synch.

<!-- Information about the project and a high level description of how the software was deployed -->
<h2>
    Implemenation and Deployment
</h2>
<p>
    Eclipse was used to develop and build my application. The application is not making use of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/devops">DevOps</a>. The application is placed on a server
    with access to both of the environments that contain the design database and the manufacturing database. The application is run once daily. Alets have been implemented for resource 
    issues like share not available, task did not run to completion, and design database not available.
</p>
<!-- This is a very high level description how the software is used -->
<h2>
    Operation Status
</h2>
<p>
    The application has been used for two years now. The process has been refined and running smoothly at this point. Design changes typically come in spurts. No issues with the application
    have arisen. Occasionally, share resources and the script which uses changes produced by my application to insert into the manufacturing database have been encountered. Overall, the project
    to date is a useful application.
