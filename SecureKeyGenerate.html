<h1>Secure Key Generation</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
    I developed a secure key generation application. The key generation application follows a set of well defined requirements which includes specific formats and algorithm used
    to create a payload. The payload is used by a classified piece of equipment to pack and unpack (encrypt and decrypt) the secure key. The secure key is used to enable and disable
    equipment function.

<h2>
    Implementation and Deployment
</h2>
<p>
    A thourough and approved set of requirements were used to implement the secure key generation applicaiton. The application is invoked on a stand alone computer (no network access). The source for
    the program is a CD generated for a particular year, month, day, and encry or decrypt function. A secure key is generated and a specific piece of hardware is connected to the standalone computer to 
    transfer the secure key produced. The equipment containing the secure key is then used to lock or unlock a larger function. Obviously, no build or deployment software is used as the application is
    executed on a single computer with no persistent external access.
</p>
<h2>
    Operation Status
</h2>
<p>
    The stand alone application is currently used in a very high security environment. Special training with a high level compartmentalized clearance is needed to use the application to enable and disable
    communication equipment.
